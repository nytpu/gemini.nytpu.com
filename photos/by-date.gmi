i was planning on posting these pictures on the web, but instead i decided to put them up on gemini, something that is probably the third-worst medium for serving photos after gopher and ttys to dumb terminals. the photos aren't necessarily good or artistic but they are ones i like, and i organized them in roughly reverse chronological order. i'll update this page from time to time when i take another photo i like.

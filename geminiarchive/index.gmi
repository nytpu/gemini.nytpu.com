I'm christening this project the “Project Gemini Gemini Archive.” Really rolls off the tongue doesn't it? It's meant to be a semi-comprehensive archive of everything about Project Gemini hosted in geminispace. So far I'm planning to pull from:
=> http://tothemoon.ser.asu.edu/gallery/Gemini the nasa/arizona state university gemini archive
=> https://www.ibiblio.org/apollo/Gemini.html virtual agc's page detailing the gemini spacecraft computer
=> https://www.ibiblio.org/apollo/links.html#Gemini_spacecraft_computer virtual agc's page of documents and schematics for project gemini

I may also add some select pieces from Project Mercury and the Apollo Program too, but I'm focusing on Project Gemini first.

It's a work in progress, check in later for some stuff
=> faq.gmi i wrote a basic faq

## the fear of missing out

irc excaberates this in me way more than anything else, I always think that I have to be on irc all the time to not miss out. I always just remind myself: it's okay, even if you miss a conversation that you would've wanted to participate in, even if someone asked a question that you could've answered, it's okay. You don't have to be on all the time.

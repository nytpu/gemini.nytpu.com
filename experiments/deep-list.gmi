# deep-list.gmi

Allows testing on how different fancy clients render multi-depth lists. If they indent first level *'s then it might look weird.

Indented with one space:
* level 1
 * level 2
  * level 3
   * level 4
 * level 2
* level 1
 * level 2
* level 1

Indented with two spaces:
* level 1
  * level 2
   * level 3
    * level 4
  * level 2
* level 1
  * level 2
* level 1

Stars for each level:
* level 1
** level 2
*** level 3
**** level 4
** level 2
* level 1
** level 2
* level 1
